    "So now we can evaluate many copy constraints by simply checking a single point. But the problem is that the verifier needs to compute the Px_a ... Px_c_prime. We want to come up with a way so that they don't need to evaluate these instead letting the prover produce an argument that they have evaluated them correctly and minimize the verifiers work. We will do that in after the next section. In the next section we will make a quick fft sidetrack cos we need that to make a performant prover. \n"
